files:

main.py - this file contains the main function. it divided into 3 parts.
part 1 - we upload the two models from the files. if we want to train the model we can 
make the files that save the models
part 2 - we open the tests data and preprocess it and predict the missing values
part 3 - we drew graphs that aggregating the data

task_1 - in these file we have the preprocess of the data for the first task.
we also have a class that contains the model we want to save after it fit, and usefully data from the train preprocess.
also, we have prepare_train_1 function that called once when we want to fit the model.
